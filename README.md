This is an artificial neuron learning project, where machine learning is practiced.
The project can augment data if needed, initialize a neuron that contains randomly generates weights and splits the dataset to learning and training datasets.
Neuron.train() initializes neuron training. Epochs, learning rate, as well as the weights' interval can be adjusted.
Neuron.test() tests the trained model with data that the neuron has not been trained on - testing dataset. The function shows accuracy, error rate and other metrices that show the performance of the trained neuron.
The project is usabe, however can be improved:
  - add data normalization
  - add better UX
  - add a feature where it is possible to train a neuron, test its performance, and continue training the same neuron. Right now it trains once and connot stop and continue training.
